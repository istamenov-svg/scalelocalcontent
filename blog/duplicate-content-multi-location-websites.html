        <h1>Duplicate Content on Multi-Location Websites:<br><em>What Actually Gets You Penalized</em></h1>
        <p class="lead">The real mechanics of how Google handles duplicate content across multi-site networks — and why most of what you've read about it is either wrong or exaggerated.</p>

        <div class="prose">
            <p>If you run a multi-location healthcare platform, someone on your marketing team has raised the alarm about duplicate content. Maybe an SEO agency told you that having similar service pages across your 50 dental practice websites will get you "penalized" by Google. Maybe you've read blog posts warning that any shared content across domains triggers a penalty.</p>

            <p>Most of this is wrong, or at least dramatically overstated. But the underlying concern is real. Here's what actually happens with duplicate content on multi-location websites, what Google's systems actually do about it, and where the real threshold is.</p>

            <h2>Google Doesn't "Penalize" Duplicate Content — It Filters It</h2>

            <p>This is the most important distinction that most SEO content gets wrong. Google has confirmed repeatedly that there is no "duplicate content penalty" in the way most people understand it. Google does not algorithmically punish your site for having content that's similar to content on another site you own.</p>

            <p>What Google does is <strong>filter</strong>. When Google encounters substantially similar content across multiple URLs, it picks one version to show in search results and suppresses the others. It doesn't demote your entire domain or tank your rankings across the board. It simply chooses the version it considers most relevant for a given query and doesn't show the duplicates.</p>

            <p>For multi-location websites, this means: if your Atlanta and Nashville dental practice websites have nearly identical homepage content with just the city name swapped, Google will likely show one of them for any given search query and suppress the other. Neither site is "penalized" — but one of them is invisible for that query.</p>

            <p>The practical effect is the same as a penalty if enough of your pages are getting filtered. You've invested in 50 websites but only a handful are showing up in search results because Google sees them as duplicates of each other.</p>

            <h2>Where the Real Threshold Is</h2>

            <p>Google hasn't published a specific percentage threshold for duplicate content filtering, and it likely doesn't use a single hard cutoff. But based on observable behavior across multi-location site networks, here's what we see in practice:</p>

            <p><strong>Above 60% content similarity across two pages:</strong> Near-certain filtering. Google will pick one and suppress the other. This is where the "swap the city name" approach lands — the content is structurally identical with only a few words changed.</p>

            <p><strong>30–60% similarity:</strong> Inconsistent filtering. Google may show both pages for different queries, or may filter one depending on the query and competitive landscape. This is the danger zone where you might think your content is "unique enough" but actually lose visibility intermittently.</p>

            <p><strong>Below 30% similarity:</strong> Generally safe. Both pages will index and rank independently. This is where genuinely differentiated content operates.</p>

            <p><strong>Below 15% similarity:</strong> No risk. The pages are substantively different even if they cover the same topic. This is our target threshold at ScaleLocalContent.</p>

            <h2>What Counts as "Similar" to Google</h2>

            <p>Google's duplicate content detection isn't a simple word-for-word comparison. It evaluates multiple signals:</p>

            <p><strong>Sentence-level matching.</strong> Identical or near-identical sentences are the strongest duplicate signal. Changing two words in a 20-word sentence doesn't make it unique. Google's systems use fuzzy matching that catches close variants.</p>

            <p><strong>Structural similarity.</strong> If two pages have the same H2 headings in the same order, the same paragraph count, the same internal linking pattern, and the same content flow — that's a duplicate signal even if the individual sentences are different. The overall "shape" of the content matters.</p>

            <p><strong>Template detection.</strong> Google has gotten increasingly sophisticated at detecting templated content — pages that were clearly generated from the same template with variable fields swapped in. The combination of identical structure, similar sentence patterns, and small variable insertions (city name, address, phone number) is a strong template signal.</p>

            <p><strong>Thin content amplification.</strong> Duplicate content issues are worse when the pages are thin. A 300-word location page with 80% shared content is more likely to be filtered than a 2,000-word page with 80% shared content, because the absolute amount of unique content on the thin page is negligible.</p>

            <h2>What Multi-Location Platforms Actually Need to Do</h2>

            <p>The solution isn't to obsess over duplicate content scores or run every page through a plagiarism checker. The solution is to produce content that's genuinely worth indexing at each location. That means:</p>

            <p><strong>Unique opening paragraphs per location.</strong> The first 150 words of any page carry disproportionate weight in how Google evaluates it. If those words are unique, you've already differentiated significantly.</p>

            <p><strong>Location-specific information that only applies to that practice.</strong> Provider names and credentials. Specific services offered at that location. Neighborhood references. Community involvement. These aren't just SEO tactics — they're information that patients actually want to see.</p>

            <p><strong>Varied content structure across locations.</strong> Don't use the same H2 headings in the same order on every site. Vary the page flow. Lead with different angles — credentials at one location, community at another, technology at a third.</p>

            <p><strong>Sufficient content depth.</strong> Thin pages are the highest risk for duplicate content filtering. Ensure every page has enough substantive content that the unique portions outweigh any shared elements.</p>

            <h2>The Real Cost of Duplicate Content</h2>

            <p>The risk isn't a dramatic penalty that tanks your rankings overnight. The risk is slow, invisible underperformance. Your 50 location websites are all indexed, they all look fine in Search Console, but only 15 of them are actually appearing in search results for their target keywords. The other 35 are being filtered out by Google in favor of whichever location it considers the "canonical" version.</p>

            <p>You'd never know this was happening unless you tracked keyword rankings at the individual location level — which most multi-location platforms don't do because their marketing teams are overwhelmed just keeping the sites running.</p>

            <p>That's why duplicate content on multi-location websites isn't a hypothetical SEO concern. It's a measurable patient acquisition problem that directly impacts the ROI of every location in your portfolio.</p>
