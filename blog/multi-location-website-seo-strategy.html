    <div class="section-narrow fade-up">
        <div class="prose">
            <p>If you operate a multi-location healthcare platform — a DSO, MSO, aesthetics group, or veterinary network — your SEO strategy has a structural problem that single-location practices don't face: you're competing with yourself.</p>

            <p>Every location website in your portfolio targets similar services in different geographies. Without a deliberate multi-location website SEO strategy, those sites will cannibalize each other's rankings, trigger duplicate content filters, and underperform in exactly the local search results where you need to win.</p>

            <p>This framework covers the three layers of a multi-location SEO strategy that actually works at scale: site architecture decisions, per-location keyword differentiation, and content production rules that prevent cross-site duplication.</p>

            <h2>Layer 1: Site Architecture — Subdomains, Subdirectories, or Separate Domains</h2>

            <p>The first decision in any multi-location website SEO strategy is how to structure the sites themselves. There are three options, and each has trade-offs.</p>

            <p><strong>Separate domains per location</strong> (e.g., buckheaddental.com, greenvillesmiles.com) — This is common in DSOs that acquire practices with existing brand equity. Each domain builds its own authority independently. The upside is maximum local branding flexibility. The downside is that you're building domain authority from scratch for every new acquisition, and you get no SEO benefit from the parent brand.</p>

            <p><strong>Subdirectories on a single domain</strong> (e.g., brand.com/locations/atlanta-buckhead) — This is the strongest approach from a pure SEO perspective. Every location page inherits the parent domain's authority. Internal linking is straightforward. But it requires all locations to operate under a unified brand, which many rollups haven't achieved yet.</p>

            <p><strong>Subdomains per location</strong> (e.g., buckhead.brand.com) — A middle ground that Google historically treated as separate sites, though this has evolved. Generally the weakest option — you get neither the authority consolidation of subdirectories nor the branding flexibility of separate domains.</p>

            <p>For most PE-backed platforms in growth mode, the practical answer is: use subdirectories if you've unified the brand, separate domains if you haven't. Avoid subdomains unless you have a specific technical reason.</p>

            <h2>Layer 2: Per-Location Keyword Strategy</h2>

            <p>The mistake most multi-location platforms make is targeting the same keywords across every location with only the city name changed. "Dentist Atlanta" and "dentist Nashville" aren't truly differentiated keyword strategies — they're the same strategy with a geographic modifier.</p>

            <p>A real per-location keyword strategy accounts for four variables:</p>

            <p><strong>Local competitive density.</strong> Some markets are saturated with dental practices competing for "dentist [city]." In those markets, you need to target more specific terms — neighborhood-level, service-specific, or provider-name queries. Other markets have low competition, and broad terms are achievable.</p>

            <p><strong>Service mix variation.</strong> Not every location offers the same services. A practice with an in-house periodontist should target implant and gum disease keywords. A practice without one shouldn't. This sounds obvious, but most multi-location content ignores it and creates identical service pages across all locations.</p>

            <p><strong>Search behavior differences by market.</strong> Patients in different regions search differently. In some markets, "dentist near me" dominates. In others, neighborhood-specific terms drive more volume. Suburban markets have different patterns than urban ones. Your keyword research needs to reflect these differences, not assume uniform behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Provider-driven search demand.</strong> In some specialties — orthopedics and cosmetic surgery especially — patients search for specific surgeons by name. If you have a high-profile provider at a location, their name plus specialty plus city is a primary keyword target.</p>

            <h2>Layer 3: Content Differentiation Rules</h2>

            <p>This is where most multi-location website SEO strategies fail in execution. Even with good architecture and solid keyword research, the content itself ends up duplicated because no one defined the rules for how content must vary across locations.</p>

            <p>Here are the rules we use:</p>

            <p><strong>Opening paragraphs must be 100% unique per location.</strong> This is the most visible signal to Google (and to patients) that the page is original. No shared sentence structures, no shared phrasing patterns, no shared metaphors. If your Atlanta page opens with a credentials-first approach, your Nashville page opens with a community-first approach.</p>

            <p><strong>H2 headings must vary in language, not just keywords.</strong> If one location's service page uses "What to Expect During Your First Visit," another shouldn't use "What to Expect at Your Appointment." Same idea, same structure. Instead: "Your First Visit: Step by Step" versus "How We Make New Patients Feel at Home." Same topic, different framing.</p>

            <p><strong>At least one paragraph per page must reference something specific to the city or neighborhood.</strong> Not "conveniently located in [city]" — that's filler. Reference a nearby landmark, a neighborhood characteristic, a local demographic pattern, or a community connection. This signals genuine local relevance to both Google and patients.</p>

            <p><strong>Provider information must be specific, not templated.</strong> "Our experienced team of dental professionals" is the same on every site. Instead, reference actual provider names, their specific credentials, where they trained, and what they specialize in. This is the highest-ROI content differentiation move because it's inherently unique per location.</p>

            <p><strong>Cross-site content similarity must stay below 15%.</strong> Use tools like Copyscape, Siteliner, or custom similarity scoring to measure overlap between the same page type across locations. If two homepage paragraphs share more than 15% identical or near-identical phrasing, rewrite one of them.</p>

            <h2>Putting It Together</h2>

            <p>A multi-location website SEO strategy isn't a single document — it's a production system. The architecture decision is made once. The keyword research is done per location. The content differentiation rules are enforced on every page of every site.</p>

            <p>The platforms that win in local search aren't the ones with the most locations. They're the ones where every location has content that genuinely earns its ranking — because it's locally relevant, keyword-targeted, and different enough from every other location in the portfolio to avoid Google's duplicate content filters.</p>

            <p>That's what a multi-location website SEO strategy actually looks like at scale.</p>
