        <div class="prose">
            <p>Your DSO just closed on a group of 30 dental practices. The integration checklist is long: credentialing, payroll, IT systems, practice management software, insurance renegotiation. Somewhere on that list — usually near the bottom — is "update websites."</p>

            <p>That line item conceals an enormous amount of work. Each practice may have an existing website of varying quality. Some might be running on decade-old WordPress installs. Others might be on a local marketing agency's proprietary platform. A few might not have a website at all beyond a Google Business Profile. And all of them need to be migrated, rebranded, or rebuilt to reflect your DSO's brand, services, and quality standards.</p>

            <p>This is a DSO website rollout playbook. It covers the operational framework, content strategy, and timeline for launching 50+ practice websites post-acquisition without destroying your marketing team.</p>

            <h2>Week 1–2: Audit and Triage</h2>

            <p>Before you build anything, you need to know what you're working with. For each acquired practice, document:</p>

            <p><strong>Current website state.</strong> Does it exist? What platform is it on? What's the domain authority? Are there any existing SEO rankings worth preserving? If a practice is ranking well for local keywords on its existing domain, a careless migration can wipe out that equity overnight.</p>

            <p><strong>Brand decision.</strong> Is this practice being rebranded to the DSO's brand, maintaining its existing name, or operating as a sub-brand? This decision determines whether you're building on the existing domain or migrating to a new one — and whether you need 301 redirects to preserve link equity.</p>

            <p><strong>Content inventory.</strong> What content exists on the current site? How much of it is salvageable? In most cases, the answer is "very little" — legacy practice websites tend to have thin, outdated content that wasn't optimized for search. But occasionally you'll find a practice with a solid blog or high-ranking service pages that are worth preserving.</p>

            <p><strong>Provider information.</strong> Get the current provider roster, credentials, headshots, and any biographical information. This is almost always the bottleneck in a DSO website rollout — providers are slow to respond, bios are outdated, and headshots are missing or inconsistent.</p>

            <h2>Week 2–3: Content Architecture</h2>

            <p>If you don't already have a content architecture for your DSO's websites, build one before you produce a single word of content. This is the framework that defines what pages each practice website needs, what each page covers, and how content must vary across locations.</p>

            <p>A typical dental practice website needs 10–15 pages: homepage, about, provider bios, 4–6 service pages (general dentistry, cosmetic, orthodontics, pediatric, emergency, implants), insurance/financing, new patient information, and contact. The exact mix varies based on each practice's service offering.</p>

            <p>The architecture also needs to define SEO keyword strategy per page type. Your general dentistry page at every location will target "[service] + [city]" keywords, but the specific secondary and long-tail keywords must be researched per location based on local competition and search volume.</p>

            <p>This architecture step is a one-time investment that pays off across every future acquisition. Build it once, apply it to every practice that joins the platform.</p>

            <h2>Week 3–5: Content Production</h2>

            <p>This is where most DSO website rollouts stall. The marketing team is 3–5 people. They're also responsible for paid media, social, reputation management, and campaign execution across the existing portfolio. Now they need to produce 500+ pages of unique content for 50 new practices.</p>

            <p>The options, and their realistic outcomes:</p>

            <p><strong>In-house production.</strong> Your team writes all the content. This produces the highest-quality, most brand-consistent output — but at a pace of maybe 2–3 practice websites per week. A 50-practice rollout takes 4–6 months. That's too slow for most PE-backed timelines.</p>

            <p><strong>Traditional agency.</strong> You hire a healthcare marketing agency. They assign a team, conduct strategy sessions, and produce content through rounds of review. Quality is usually good. Speed is usually 6–10 weeks for 50 practices. Cost is usually $100K–$250K. You'll also spend significant internal time managing the agency relationship.</p>

            <p><strong>Content mill.</strong> You use a low-cost content service that charges per word or per article. Turnaround is fast — maybe 2 weeks for 50 practices. Cost is low — maybe $5K–$15K. But the content is generic, undifferentiated, and often not even healthcare-specific. You'll end up with the same page across all 50 sites with city names swapped, which creates the duplicate content problem that kills local search visibility.</p>

            <p><strong>AI-accelerated production with human QA.</strong> This is the approach we built ScaleLocalContent around. Structured production systems generate locally differentiated content using per-location keyword research, provider-specific information, and content differentiation rules. Every batch runs through cross-site similarity QA before delivery. 50 practices in 5–7 business days at a fraction of agency cost.</p>

            <h2>Week 5–6: QA, CMS Migration, and Go-Live</h2>

            <p>Content is only half the DSO website rollout. The other half is getting it published. This involves:</p>

            <p><strong>Template deployment.</strong> If you're migrating all practices to a unified CMS and template, the template needs to be built, tested, and deployed before content can be loaded. Mobile responsiveness, page speed, schema markup, and conversion elements (click-to-call, appointment booking) all need to be validated.</p>

            <p><strong>Content loading.</strong> Getting the content into the CMS for all 50 practices. This is a manual process unless you've built (or purchased) tooling to automate it. Factor in time for image sourcing, alt-text, internal linking, and meta tag implementation.</p>

            <p><strong>301 redirect mapping.</strong> If any practice had an existing website with SEO equity, you need to map old URLs to new URLs with 301 redirects. Missing this step means losing whatever search rankings the practice had before acquisition — which is the opposite of what you want.</p>

            <p><strong>Google Business Profile updates.</strong> Every practice's GBP needs to point to the new website URL. This is often overlooked and left to practice managers, who don't do it. Centralize this task.</p>

            <p><strong>Indexing and validation.</strong> After go-live, submit new sitemaps to Google Search Console, verify indexing, and monitor for crawl errors. For large rollouts, Google may take several weeks to fully index all new pages.</p>

            <h2>The Timeline Reality</h2>

            <p>A 50-practice DSO website rollout can be done in 6 weeks with the right systems and content production approach. It can also take 6 months if you rely on traditional methods and an understaffed internal team.</p>

            <p>The difference isn't just about speed — it's about what happens during the gap. Every week a newly acquired practice operates without an optimized website is a week of lost patient acquisition. Multiply that across 50 practices, and the revenue impact of a delayed rollout is significant enough to justify investing in faster content production.</p>

            <p>PE-backed DSOs are evaluated on growth metrics. The website rollout is a direct input to same-store growth at acquired practices. Treating it as a back-burner integration task is a strategic mistake that shows up in the numbers.</p>
