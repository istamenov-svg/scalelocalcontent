            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Marcon Groupe LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), operating as ScaleLocalContent, collects, uses, and protects information when you visit scalelocalcontent.com (the "Site") or engage our services.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <p><strong>Information you provide directly.</strong> When you submit a form on our Site, you may provide your name, email address, company name, phone number, and details about your project. We collect this information solely to respond to your inquiry and scope potential engagements.</p>

            <p><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> When you visit our Site, our hosting provider (GitHub Pages) and third-party services may automatically collect certain technical data, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URL, pages visited, and the date and time of your visit. This data is collected through server logs and does not personally identify you.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <p>We use the information we collect to respond to your inquiries and contact form submissions, communicate with you about potential or existing engagements, improve our Site and services, and comply with legal obligations. We do not use your information for automated decision-making, profiling, or behavioral advertising.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            <p><strong>Formspree.</strong> Contact form submissions are processed through Formspree, Inc. When you submit a form, your data is transmitted to Formspree's servers for delivery to our email. Formspree's privacy policy governs their handling of this data.</p>

            <p><strong>Google Fonts.</strong> Our Site loads typefaces from Google Fonts, which may result in your browser connecting to Google's servers. Google may collect technical data such as your IP address in connection with this request.</p>

            <p><strong>GitHub Pages.</strong> Our Site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect technical data from visitors as described in their privacy statement.</p>

            <p>We do not use analytics tracking tools, advertising pixels, or retargeting services on this Site.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>

            <p>Our Site does not set any first-party cookies. Third-party services (such as Google Fonts) may set cookies in accordance with their own policies. You can control cookie behavior through your browser settings.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share information only in the following circumstances: with service providers who assist in operating our Site or delivering our services (such as Formspree for form processing), when required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Marcon Groupe LLC, our clients, or the public.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>

            <p>We retain contact form submissions and related correspondence for as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry and for a reasonable period thereafter for record-keeping purposes. You may request deletion of your information at any time by contacting us.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>

            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information you provide. Our Site is served over HTTPS, and form submissions are transmitted via encrypted connections. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

            <p>Our Site and services are not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access the personal information we hold about you, request correction or deletion of your personal information, object to or restrict our processing of your information, and request a copy of your information in a portable format. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at hello@scalelocalcontent.com.</p>

            <h2>California Residents</h2>

            <p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). You have the right to know what personal information we collect and how it is used, request deletion of your personal information, and opt out of the sale of personal information (we do not sell personal information). To exercise these rights, contact us at hello@scalelocalcontent.com.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Site after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
