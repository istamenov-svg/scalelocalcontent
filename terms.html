            <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of scalelocalcontent.com (the "Site"), operated by Marcon Groupe LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), doing business as ScaleLocalContent. By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Site.</p>

            <h2>Use of the Site</h2>

            <p>The Site is provided for informational purposes and to facilitate inquiries about our services. You agree to use the Site only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use of the Site.</p>

            <p>You may not use the Site to transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, spam, or promotional material, collect or harvest personal information from other users, attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Site or its systems, use the Site in any way that could damage, disable, or impair its functionality, or introduce any viruses, malicious code, or harmful material.</p>

            <h2>Services</h2>

            <p>The Site describes content creation and related services offered by ScaleLocalContent. Information on the Site regarding services, pricing, and deliverables is provided for general informational purposes and does not constitute a binding offer. All engagements are governed by separate service agreements executed between Marcon Groupe LLC and the client.</p>

            <p>Pricing, scope, timelines, and deliverables described on the Site are representative and may vary based on the specifics of each engagement. Final terms are established in written agreements.</p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

            <p>All content on the Site — including text, graphics, design, layout, code, and branding — is the property of Marcon Groupe LLC or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

            <p>You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, publicly display, or otherwise exploit any content on the Site without our prior written consent.</p>

            <p>Ownership of content produced through our services is governed by the terms of each client's service agreement. The Site's Terms of Use do not address ownership of deliverables — that is established in the applicable engagement contract.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>

            <p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites or services. We do not control and are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites. Inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement.</p>

            <p>While we strive to provide accurate information about our services, we make no guarantees regarding search engine rankings, AI Overview placement, traffic outcomes, or patient acquisition results. Content strategy and SEO are subject to factors outside our control, including search engine algorithm changes.</p>

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>

            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Marcon Groupe LLC, its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the Site or your violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>

            <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Site shall be resolved in the courts located in Broward County, Florida.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
